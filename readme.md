## BBSMenu - Blender BPY Script


Hello! This is WobbleOranges Triangle Generator script, but in UI Form!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38820051/187057126-1cc00291-8fa9-4e30-aa49-003094562d48.png)


I found the scripting way of the Triangle Generator a little hard, especially for new people, so I made this UI Version.

In the middle of making specifically the Triangle Generator UI, I thought of adding more features other than triangle generator into this. So I called it BBSMenu.

### Features:

[WobbleOrange Triangle Generator](https://discord.com/channels/841467564089147434/994980004431663134/994989319255232532), UI Based.

Info Menu containing:

**Amount Chart**

**Tells you what shape your Generating?**

# What I have planned 

### BBSMenu Specifically:

Other features not yet named.

### Triangle Generator:

Set material to shapes generated ( Good for AddPrimaryGroups featured in [Remapper](https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper) )

Better way to set Integers

I dont want to upload the script yet without full permission as I wasnt the one who made the actual script. Should be uploaded within 2 days... or NEVER.

You can still check in [releases](https://github.com/UGEcko/BlenderBSMenu/releases) :)
